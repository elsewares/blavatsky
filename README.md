BLAVATSKY

JSON APIs are all well and good for machines and spiffy Javascript code, but what if there's no RSS feed equivalent?

You need a medium to translate.

Blavatsky is a CakePHP app that takes a given JSON feed, asks questions _a la_ [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com)'s channels and produces an RSS2 compliant feed based on the results.

WHY?
-----

I wanted an RSS-to-email channel in [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) for new Google Web Fonts, which only has a (very nice!) JSON REST API.

WHERE?
------

The dev version will be at [blavatsky.elsewares.org](http://blavatsky.elsewares.org).  A prod version will be on Heroku thereafter.

HOW?
-----
Built on:
* CakePHP 2.x
* Twitter Bootstrap
